# Beginner Media Recommendations

!!! note "Incomplete List"  
	This list is not final and will be updated in the future. Please submit any suggestions in TheMoeWay Discord server.  

This is a list of beginner friendly Japanese media including anime, manga, novels and games.  


Note that your consumption does not need to be restricted to this list, but it should help give a few pointers if you are either new to Japanese media and are looking for a good entry point or have a lot of trouble with other media.  
You should also keep in mind that at the beginner stage, most things if not everything will feel "hard" and the only way to get around that is to immerse more combined with your formal study (Anki decks, grammmar). With that being said, here is the list.  

## Anime
