These dictionaries, especially the monolingual inclusions will not have been possible to such a high standard if it weren't for **epistularum(エピス)
#9370**. If you come across any issue with any of the dictionaries, please contact him on Discord.  

## All dictionaries explained  

Below you can find an explanation of every dictionary available in the dictionary pack.   

### Bilingual  

**JMDict (English)** - This is the most popular Japanese to English dictionary. It is used in many Japanese to English dictionary projects including Jisho.org, Shirabe Jisho and Akebi. This is the dictionary most people will be using as a beginner learning Japanese, and you may end up using it even when you're at an "advanced" level because it is one of the biggest dictionaries.  

**JMdict (English) Alternate** - Older version of JMdict (English) available for download on the official Yomichan website. Included because some people may prefer the formatting for Anki card creation.  

**KireiCake** - JMdict with extra inclusions, especially slang, expressions and grammar. There will be a lot of overlap with this and the 
JMdict.  

**研究社　新和英大辞典　第５版** - Kenkyuusha New Japanese-English Dictionary 5th Edition. This is a Japanese to English dictionary made for Japanese learners of English, it is especially good as it includes example sentences that help you grasp the feeling of a word better. 

**新和英** - Version of 研究社　新和英大辞典　第５版 without example sentences for people that prefer it.  

### Monolingual  

**三省堂 大辞林 第三版** - 3rd edition of Sanseido's Daijirin, a very popular Japanese to English dictionary, it is used in many online dictionary websites including Goo, Weblio and Kotobank. It is also included in Apple products. This is my go-to dictionary and also the dictionary and also the only monolingual dictionary to support the kanji repetition mark (々). Looking up 各々 will only work with this dictionary!  

**大修館書店 明鏡国語辞典** - Meikyo dictionary by Taishukan. My top recommendation for beginner monolingual users.  


**小学館 デジタル大辞泉** -
