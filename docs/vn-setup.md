# Cross Platform Visual Novel Setup   

<h2> Acquiring visual novels </h2>

Check out the [Resources](/resources/#the-following-may-be-nsfw) page to find where to get Visual novels.

Visual novels are distributed commonly in disc image files. Usually in .ISO and sometimes .MDF/.MDS files, or, these files but contained in a .rar/.zip/.7z file.

!!! question "Glossary: disc image file"
	A disc image file does not refer to a picture of a disc, rather it is a file (usually `.iso`) that contains an exact copy of what was on a disc. Remember: Japanese visual novels are sold on optical discs, and then people make an exact copy of what was on the disc onto an `.iso` or `.mdf/.mds` file.
