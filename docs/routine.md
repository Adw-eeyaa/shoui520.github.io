# 30 Day Japanese (UsagiSpoon)  

A routine for people that are lost on how to start learning. You don't have to follow this that is why it is not part of the main guide.  

The routines are split into days. Each day has tasks that you need to do.  

What you'll expect to know at the end of the 30 days:

- An understanding of the most common Japanese grammar patterns
- A vocabulary of at least 500 words.  
- An understanding of basic sentences in slice of life anime.  
- The ability to read hiragana, katakana and some common kanji.  
- A good foundation to continue learning Japanese on your own.  

What I expect from you: 

- **the will to learn**    
- a computer (sorry phone users)  

It has been years since I was a beginner at Japanese, but recently I have tried learning other languages, so my memories of what it was like being a beginner came back to me. I tried my best to make this study guide as approachable as possible.  

### Stage: Pre kana stage  

## Day 1 

Copy out [the chart from the main guide](/img/hiragana_katakana_LARGE.png).  
It is important you learn how to write kana as this can also make it easier to differentiate them too. Don't worry if your handwriting is not pretty.  
You can do it on a paper or a screen, it doesn't matter really.   

Then, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wZHqOghvSs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wZHqOghvSs)  
It is a video by JapanesePod. This should probably be the only Japanese Pod video you should watch though, just sayin'.  

Go on this website. [https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html)    
Click "show/hide options"  
Click "check all" for the categories (Hiragana, Hiragana combinations, Katakana, Katakana combinations). Don't worry about the fonts.   
Type the correct romaji in the text box. This is how you'll practice your kana.  
Do this for 10 minutes.  
You can use this timer here: [https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/)  

### Stage: Creating your own Japan at home

## Day 2

Practice on this site [https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html) for 10 minutes. Timer here: [https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/). Do not forget that all kana must be enabled.  

Making your daily life surrounded by Japanese is the most important part of the immersion method. 
It may be hard to decide, but you'll need to find content that interests you and you'll need to make consuming it a habit.  

Slice of life is a good place to start.  
There are many, many anime that have simple Japanese.  

Here are some suggestions, (but you can use anything you want):  

Love Live! (Any)  
Non non Biyori  
Kimetsu no Yaiba  	
Koe no katachi  
Hotarubi no Mori e    
Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo    
Himouto! Umaru-chan  
Nakitai Watashi wa Neko o Kaburu  
Yuru Yuri  
Precure (Any)  
Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight  
K-on  
Ao haru Ride  
Usagi drop  
Flying witch  
Byousoku 5 centimeter  
Kiniro Mosaic  
New Game  

See [Anime Resources](https://learnjapanese.moe/resources/#anime) for places to find anime. Downloading the anime is preferred because it makes it easier to bring the anime portably.  

**Q: Everything here is so boooooring!!!! I'd rather watch something actually good!**

A: And I like your way of thinking! Immersion is all about spending time with content that interests you. So please, don't limit yourself to my suggestions.  



I want you to try immersing for the first time with the "subtitle tutor" method.  
The subtitle tutor method is where you watch an episode of an anime with English subtitles, then watch it again without subtitles. Then listen to it when doing other things (wireless earbuds makes this easier). 

The flowchart process is this:

1. Watch with English subtitles  
2. Watch without any subtitles  
3. Are you done for today? (Yes=Put the episodes on in the background to listen while you do other things. | No= Go back to step 1.)

Essentially, by watching the episode with subtitles first, you have increased the comprehensibility of your input.  

By listening to it when doing other things you are filling in the silence with Japanese, which means, even if for a few seconds, you may pay attention to what's being said.  

Note: Listening while doing other things = **passive immersion**. Listening with undivided attention = **active immersion**  


**Q: Why immersion before any grammar or vocabulary study?** 

A: Some of you might have wondered why I want you to immerse without knowing any grammar or whatever. And that's because listening is the crux of learning a language. Native speakers are so good at their language because of the environment (the language being there wherever they go), and by replicating that environment you can expect to replicate the results. Listening a lot even if you don't understand makes it easier to learn new words in Japanese and get a deeper feel for the language.  

**Q: So I've completed my first episode, what should I do now?**

A: Watch another!!!

**Q: How many?**

A: Let a 4 sided dice decide that. 

[https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

Roll!  

The number you get is the number of anime episodes you watch for today!  

I didn't want to overwhelm you on your second day, so you'll start learning about grammar tomorrow.  

### Stage: Just starting grammar

## Day 3

Do your daily kana practice on this site! [https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html) for 10 minutes.  
Use a timer here: [https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/)  


Now here's where you'll start grammar.  

You don't need to do any drills or anything like that.   

You don't need to choose the correct patterns or anything like that.  

Everything you will be learning is insanely common and will be reinforced with your daily immersion.    

The grammar guide I want you to use is Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese.  

The playlist is here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj)  

All I want you to do is **watch the videos** and **take notes** (Google note taking site here: [https://keep.google.com/](https://keep.google.com/))  

Note: I recommend turning on the subtitles for cure dolly's videos.   

**Watch 3 videos a day**  

That is a good number, you will be near the end of her guide after 30 days at that pace.  

**Take notes.**    

**Q: What should I even put in my notes?**  

A: You should put information that you feel is important. Rely on your instincts. If Cure Dolly says this is that, then you might want to take a note of that.   
Your notes do not need to be detailed, and you don't need to show them to anyone.  
Your notes are YOUR notes, make them your notes.  

**Q: Why should I even do notes! I can probably remember everything anyway!**

A: I want you to take notes so you can go over them whenever you need to. (Keyword: when **you** need to!)   
You are essentially making your own little mini version of the videos in your notes.  
So if you *do* forget something, you can always just look at your notes.  

**Q: I really don't want to take notes...**  
A: And that is fine!  

Note-taking is an area where I do think personal preference is involved.  

### Stage: Just done your first grammar lessons

After you watched your first 3 Cure Dolly videos, you can consider that your **"grammar session done for the day".**  

Now what I want you to do is immerse.  

You know the drill.  

[Roll a 4 sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)   

If you get 1, then that is unfortunate. 1 episode is not enough immersion in my opinion. You might want to think of the dice as "how much episodes I'm going to watch before getting up" probably.

**Q: Do I need to do the "subtitle tutor" method?**  

A: The subtitle tutor method is **not required**. It is merely a way to make immersion more interesting in the beginning. 
I merely presented it to you as a method that is available to you.  

**Q: What do I do if i keep hearing a word that interests me and want to know what it means?**

A: First of all, that's great!  
You can use https://jisho.org/ to search up the word. 
There's a chance you might be mishearing it so you may not be able to find out.  

Tomorrow will get more complex. So, uh, look forward to it...?  

## Day 4  

### Stage: Learning kanji and new words: Using anki for the first time.  

Today you'll be:  

- Practicing kana  
- Studying grammar  
- Using anki for the first time
- Learning new words and kanji in Anki. 
- Seting up a Japanese keyboard on your pc 
- Doing your daily immersion.  

It is a lot. Please make sure you have enough time today.   

Practice your kana on this site [https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html) for 10 minutes.  

[10 Minute Timer Here](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/10minutes/)  

After that, do your daily grammar study.  

Remember the routine from the previous day: **3 Cure Dolly videos**!   

After you've done that, let's download Anki.  

First i want you to watch this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUITtA1jJI)  

Now let's actually download Anki.  

You can download Anki by visiting the official website ([here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)) and clicking on the Download button. It should scroll the page down to the downloads section. Click the first option.  

Download the required deck [here](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/)  

When you first open Anki, the first thing you'll see is the "interface language selector". This just decides what language Anki will be displayed in. Any language is fine. 

Go into **Tools** on the top bar, and click **Preferences (Ctrl+P)**.  

In this window, click on the **Scheduling** tab, and check (✓) the option "*V3 Scheduler*" and from the drop down box, choose "*Show new cards before reviews*".  

And change the **Learn ahead limit** to `900`.  

Now click Close.  

In Anki, there are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window. The button **Import File** is how you'll be importing your downloaded deck. 
Once clicked, it should open the file picker window.   

Choose your downloaded deck.  


When it finishes importing it should show you a box with bunch of text. Just press ok.  

Now you'll see the deck and a blue number next to it.  

The blue number is how many new cards you will be doing in a day.  

20 cards is the default.  

20 cards may or not be manageable.  

You might want to lower the amount of cards if you find it too hard to keep up with reviews. But don't worry about it right now.   

Click on the cog icon next to the deck. 

Click *Options*.  

Change **Maximum reviews/day** to `9999`. This just means "uncapped".  

The default is 200 and I don't think your cards will pile up that high if you do Anki everyday but,  

It is good practice to uncap your review limit.  

Just some Anki know-how.  

You also need to change the **Learning steps** to `1m 5m 1h`.  

Now click *Save*.  

When you click on the name of the deck, you'll be able to start learning by clicking *Study now*  

First thing you'll notice....

There's a word you can read... "suru"...

But there is also line below it with absolutely CRAZY kanji....

Ignore that!  

Only focus on the top line. That's what you actually need to learn.  

The line below it is just an example sentence.  

I can't say its very useful at this point.  

But everything in this deck is insanely common.  

Now I want you to read this carefully,

What you are actually being tested for is, whether or not you can read the word and ALSO know what it means.  

In Japanese learning we call this "learning the **reading** and **meaning**"  

For a word like, する, the **reading** is easy. It's just する! It isn't in kanji. The next word though, does use kanji.  

When you click *Show answer* at the bottom (shortcut: ++space++), you can see what the word means.  

This deck also other interesting features.  

A picture at the back.  

Audio at the back.  

The picture illustrates the example sentence. It is not important.  

There is also a sentence translation at the bottom.  

Scroll down if you can't see it.  

Wait a second.  

You might have been wondering. Why can't I even see the word in the example sentence it is supposed to be in?  

The reason is, it is actually there, it is just inflected.  

Inflections are something you will learn from Cure Dolly.  

These inflections are absolutely CRAZY for you right now, so do not worry about learning inflections from this deck.  

The example sentences are too advanced for you.  

When you learn a word in Japanese, you learn its "base" form. This means its un-inflected form.  

Wait a second.  

So what do you actually do from here?  

Well, you see that white line at the top going through the card?  

That is the separator between the "front" and the "back" of the card.  

The **first** line on the **back** of the card is the **Reading**.  

The **second** line on the **back** of the card is the **Meaning**.  

Those are the 2 pieces of information that you must remember.  

Do not waste your brain power on thinking about anything else.  

Look at the bottom bar. There are 4 buttons. These are your grading options. 

In Anki, you have to manually grade yourself.   

Think of **Again** as "I FAILED". **Easy** as SUPER EASY, **Good** as normal/usual/eh, and **Hard** as "I struggled with this it took me a while BUT I still got it right".  

Because this is a card that is **seen for the first time**, press "Again".  

When seeing "unseen cards" (cards that you haven't graded yet.) it is common and best practice to reveal the back (by pressing Show answer), then read the important information (Reading and Meaning) and then pressing **Again**.  

This will send the card to the "Learning" pile. 

You see the red number on the bottom bar turned from 0 to 1?  

The red number is the learning pile.  

Blue: New pile  
Red: Learning pile  
Green: Review pile  

The learning pile means Anki will show you the card multiple times so you can remember it. 

Getting a "Good" enough times will cause the card to graduate. This means you'll see it in *x* number of days (Usually 1 day for new cards).  

After you have successfully learned 20 cards, you can consider your Anki done for the day.  

The next day you can expect to see some cards in the green (Review) pile. 

You will also have a fresh batch of 20 new cards!  

Please make sure you do Anki every day!   

  


Now let's set up a Japanese keyboard. 

See this: [http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/](http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/ilrc/technical-support/jpn-win-keyboard-entry/)  

This article is very good. 

After you've done that lemme teach you the most useful functions.

++alt++++grave++ (backquote)(the key left of 1): Switch from entering just letters like these to kana like this: かな. if you type "kana" when the symbol on the taskbar is an "A" it will just be "kana" but if the symbol is あ then it will become "かな"

++space++: Conversion. When you want to type a kanji, you have to type its reading, and then use space to convert it. Due to Japanese's... japanesesiness, there are multiple conversion candidates for the kana you entered. Let's try a word you probably just learned, like 言う. To type that in kanji you have to switch to kana input mode (the あ symbol) and type いう, then press space until 言う is selected, and then press ++enter++. If you want to enter kana without converting, just type what you want and press enter.  

++f7++: Katakana conversion. 

++win++++space++: Switch input methods (only effective if you have more than one input method (example `English (UK)` and `Japanese (Japan)`)  


Now I think it is about time you do your daily immersion.  

I hope the dice game helped you get used to immersing.  

I recommend you decide on a set number of anime episodes to use for immersion per day.  

If you can't decide, then by all means, let a dice decide for you! 

[Roll a dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+dice)    

I personally recommend at least 3 hours of immersion per day.

That is around **9 anime episodes**.  

That is a lot of episodes.  

But more listening more better!  

## Day 5  

At this point you'll be struggling with kana less. So I suggest spending less time on practicing it. 

Go on this site [https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html) and practice kana for 5 minutes. [https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/5minutes/](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/5minutes/).  

Now do your Anki *reps* (reps = repetitions).  

Anki is tough in the beginning.  

But it gets better I promise!  

Your Anki today will be slightly different. You'll have a blue number AND a green number next to the deck.  

The **green** number is your **reviews**.  

Make sure you stay on top of your reviews!  

Important word of advice: If you ever become unable to keep up with piling reviews, then reduce your new cards per day limit!  

After you've done your Anki for the day, you should get onto your daily grammar study.  

**3 Cure Dolly videos!**  

After that, it's just your daily immersion.  

**Q: How many episodes will it be???**  

A: [Generate 1 number between 4 and 10 here.](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/random-number-generator.php)  


## Day 6  

### Stage: First ever reading practice: Japanese subtitles! 

Today you'll start reading practice for the first time!  

It is going to be quite tough.  

But don't worry if you don't understand it!  

Every bit counts!  

First, practice kana for 5 minutes.  

[Kana Practice Site](https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/learn/kana.html)  
[5 Minute Timer](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/timer/5minutes/)  

After that, go on to doing your Anki.  

After your Anki, do your 3 Cure Dolly videos.  

Then let's get on to reading.  

Your first reading content will be anime with Japanese subtitles.  

It is kind of tricky to set it up, but let's go through it.  

First, you will need Yomichan.

Click on this [link](/yomichan) to read my guide on it.  

After you have set up Yomichan, follow the rest of these steps. 

In your Chrome extension settings (`chrome://extensions`), enable "**Developer mode**" in the **top right**.  

Now download the [asbplayer Extension](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer/releases)  

It has to be installed manually, it is not on the Chrome Web Store.  

You need to unzip the .zip file first.  

Now you go in your Chrome extension settings and click "Load unzipped"  

Choose the unzipped folder.  

Restart your browser.  

Now you need to get subtitle files for the anime you want to watch.  

Let's just use... Love Live (2013) as an example.  

The site [Kitsunekko](https://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles%2Fjapanese%2F) has the biggest collection of Japanese subtitles for anime.   

**(NOTE: The site has a tendency of going down randomly. You can view a backup [here](/kitsubackup.html#/ja))**    

I scrolled down to "Love Live!", and downloaded the "Love Live! (01-13) (Webrip).zip" file.  

After unzipping the file, I got a bunch of .SRT files. 

.SRT files are subtitle files.  

Now what you need to do is drag and drop an .SRT file onto a video.  

The asbplayer extension works with [zoro.to](https://zoro.to/). I recommend streaming from there.  

When an episode starts playing, you can drag and drop an .SRT file onto it.  

The subtitles should just work, and by using ++shift++ on a word, Yomichan should pop up with a dictionary definition. 

But there is a problem. The subtitle file for Love Live is horribly **out of sync**!  

This means the subtitles don't match the timing of the audio.  

Luckily, asbplayer supports adjusting the timing.  

You can do that with ++ctrl++++shift++++left++ or ++right++. Sometimes it doesn't work if you don't click on the video first.  

You will need to experiment to find the right timing. For Love Live it was -8400ms.  

It might be hard to figure out what subtitle belongs to what audio when reading is so difficult. 

Sentences written in kana make it easier to tell which is which though.  

This page [https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/](https://killergerbah.github.io/asbplayer/) displays the subtitles in a list. This makes it easier to go back to a line you missed.  

**This also enables you to "read" the anime! Which I recommend you do!!!**    

So what's the routine?  

**Watch** the anime with Japanese subtitles first.  

Then focus your attention on **just reading** it.  

**Q: How much words do I look up?**  

A: I think you should decide this using a 20 sided dice, per episode.  

[Click here for 20 sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+20+sided+dice)  

Roll!  

After you've looked up your amount just *watch* the rest with Japanese subs.  

If anything piques your interest, then feel free to look it up!  

**Q: How can I expect to remember the words I look up?**  

A: Great question! It all comes down to repetition. The more reading you do, the more words you will remember.  

In other words, don't fuss over the words you look up right now.  

Looking over them a gajillion times isn't a productive use of your time.  

What you should actually do is: Look at the meaning, look at the reading. Then go like "Oh, right!". And move on.  

**Q: How do I figure out where a word starts and ends? Japanese has no spaces!**  

A: The simple answer is, it is hard to tell as a beginner.  

You get better at it over time.  

Language learning is just pattern recognition after all.  

Yomichan is a great help because it knows where words start and end with 90% accuracy.  

**Q: Now that I can see the Japanese, can I try to translate it in my head?**  

A: It's complicated...   

There are always forms of expression that just aren't compatible between English and Japanese. The way of thinking is a lot of different.  

This is the main reason why this method (and similar ones) tend to advise against trying to translate your immersion.  

Because Japanese is not English.  

You are advised to think of Japanese as Japanese.  

Be the language!  

You can do some sort of "loose translation", where you just try to piece together some sort of basic meaning.  

Do I need to translate at all?  

Not always, it is inevitable that there are things you will just not understand due to many factors. (missing knowledge of: word meaning, word meaning thats hard to understand just from the dictionary, grammar usage, advanced grammar usage, context, how the word is generally used in the wider scope of language etc.)  

It is also tiring, so do it in moderation.  

**Q: How much episodes should I watch with Japanese subs until I go back to no subs?**  

A: Let a 4 sided dice decide.  

[Roll a 4 sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+4+sided+dice)  

**Q: How should I decide whether to watch a new episode without subs or with Japanese subs?**

A: [Flip a coin](https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin).

Heads = no subs  
Tails = JP subs

**Q: When can I go back to switching between English and no subs?**  

A: After you've watched x amount of episodes with Japanese subs. (Decided by 4 sided dice.)    

## Day 7  

### Stage: Learning how to balance as a beginner.    

Step 1. Do your Anki.  
Step 2. Cure Dolly routine.  
Step 3. Immerse!! (Details below)  

Focusing on a particular area of your Japanese (e.g. listening or reading) is good.  

But how will you decide whether today is a day where you'll focus on listening or reading?  

For an advanced learner that can already read books and understand a lot of things, this is more obvious.  

But for a beginner, it can be tough to decide.  

The simple answer?  

[Flip a coin](https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin).  

Heads = Listening day  
Tails = Reading day  

## Day 8

### Stage: The elephant in the room... kanji!  

Kanji look like scribbles don't they?  

For a beginner, they look nonsensical.  

But for an experienced learner, they look like actual shapes and familiar faces.  

Every kanji can be broken down into fundamental shapes. Also known as radicals. Or "primitives" (term used in Remembering the Kanji).

Example: 萌 = 艹+日+月  
Example: 踏 = 足+水+日  
Example: 足 = 口+龰  
Example: 将 = 丬+爫+寸  


I recommend you do the "Recognition Remembering the Kanji 450" Anki deck.  

[Download it here](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ)  

Import it.  

Do it at a steady 5 cards per day.  

Do not try to rush it.  

You already have the Core deck you're working through.  

The purpose of the deck is to steadily give you the ability to see kanji as a combination of consistent shapes.  

5 cards per day.  

Don't rush it.  

Click the cog icon next to the 日本語 parent deck.  

Now click Options.  

There is a drop down box at the top of this window.  

Change Default to *Recognition RTK*.  

Change **New cards/day** to `5`  

Click Save.  

When you click Study now, the first cards will be explanation cards.  

After you read them, and understood the usage of the deck, I recommend suspending them.  

You will be working on this deck alongside the Core deck.  

This deck will NOT help you read kanji.  
This deck will NOT help you write kanji from memory.  
This deck will NOT help you guess the meanings of words.  

This deck WILL help you see kanji as compositions of consistent shapes.  

It is an important skill to have, because when you are learning Japanese for a long time you will come across a ton of words and you may confuse them if the kanji look too similar for you.  

**Q: So what do I need to do today?**

1. Anki. Your Core deck and the RRTK deck.  
2. Grammar. Watch 3 Cure Dolly videos.
3. Immersion.  

**Q: Immersion...?**

Yes, you can do reading/watch with Japanese subs/raw listening/subtitle tutor.  

You can decide everything with a dice and flipping a coin if you're uncertain, of course.  

I apologize if "immersion" is a vague term.  

All of that stuff that you did with the anime and the subtitles and the Yomichan is immersion.  

## Day 9  

### Stage: Repetition starts to settle in  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

This is the fundamental process of the method. Keep doing what you're doing.  

But longer hours = more improvement!  
So try and aim for longer immersion hours!  

**Q: I've been thinking about looking up a lot of words in reading, is this bad or good?**

A: It's good! But please note if you make yourself look up a ton of words all the time, there is a risk of **burning out** and loss of enjoyment. 

This method relies on **your consistency**.  

To stay consistent, you need to make sure you're setting yourself manageable goals.  

## Day 10  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

You may want to look into [Condensed Audio](/resources#condensed-audio), this is way to maximize the efficiency of passive listening.  

Passive listening is when you listen to Japanese audio when you are doing other things.  

While passive listening there are moments where you may be paying attention to the Japanese.  

Think of it as filling in the silence with Japanese.  

Or, listening to Japanese at every possible opportunity. 

Condensed audio removes non-speech parts of the audio, making it more efficient.  

If you have wireless earbuds, listening all the time becomes a lot easier.  

## Day 11  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  


**Q: MUST I do all my daily tasks in this exact order you have written?**  

A: Nononono! Absolutely not.  

You can even do immersion first thing, or grammar first thing, or even Anki right at the end of the day. This is an area where people just have preferences and things that work better for them.  

**Note: Just make sure you don't miss Anki!**  

## Day 12  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

Yes, another day of immersing. Maybe day 12 can be *Non-Non Biyori* day. (Unless you've already immersed with it :P)     

**Q: Can I listen to the same things over and over again?**  

A: Absolutely! But if it gets boring, then switch to new content.  

Listening to the same content has huge benefits, but it can get boring and also you miss opportunities to hear new, useful things.   

## Day 13  

Daily routine:

1. Anki  
2. Grammar  
3. Immersion  

Here's an interesting challenge for you today.  

Look up **50** words in your Japanese subtitles anime reading practice.  

## Day 14

Congratulations on making it this far!  

I know it has been tough (especially Anki and reading!), but the beginner stage is always the hardest part of learning any language, and things will only get easier the longer you do it.  

With more time spent doing the right methods, you'll certainly improve.  

You may have your doubts on what this method is actually doing, so allow me to explain.  

Your **Anki**,　 **grammar study** and **looking up words** are where you are increasing your *knowledge* of the language.  

Your **listening** and **reading** practice are where you are **applying** your *knowledge*, by getting exposure to how these parts of the language are used by natives.  

The **subtitle tutor method** aims to boost the **comprehensibility** of your **listening immersion** by giving you context of what is being said in the audio.  

Your **Japanese subtitle listening** helps you: associate kana with sounds, figure out what words are being said and ease you into reading.  

Your **raw (no subs) listening practice** is where you build a mental model of how the language actually sounds. This is good for a number of reasons. The main reasons being getting a good accent, and also being able to hear the words that you know. Listening isn't as clear as reading, it can be very fast and hard to keep up with. By getting used to raw listening you can train yourself to hear these unclear things better.  

When you get advanced at Japanese and understand your raw listening immersion, mass raw listening is the only way to get fluent.  

Your **passive listening** fills in the gaps where you otherwise wouldn't be doing Japanese.  

### Stage: 100 page Yotsubato! challenge  

From today until the 30th day. I want you to challenge yourself to read 100 pages of the よつばと！ manga.  

よつばと！ is a great slice of life manga that features furigana (kana on the top of kanji).  

Manga are tricky to look up words on because they are essentially, text on images.  

But there are many tools out there that make this process easier.  

There is a particularly crazy one known as *mokuro* that turns the manga into a HTML page.  

The text bubbles turn into text you can actually use Yomichan on, just like a normal web page!  

よつばと！ has some non-standard ways of writing words that make it tricky to use a dictionary with. Such as そう being written as そー

This "ー" is not the kanji 一 (one). It is actually a vowel elongation mark.  

It is known as "長音" (ちょうおん). The kanji of this mean long, sound!.    

とー would be とう. びー would be びい. etc.    

I have made a Yotsubato reading helper to help you with words like these.  

**Everything you need is in this .zip file: [(Download)](https://mega.nz/file/JRxmAZyA#qfHSC-gjBxkumlELYrP6oIz3-p_dZka0Dgg4q1eTbEo)**    

Japanese manga is in vertical text. This means the text is read **downwards** from the **rightmost** line to the **leftmost** line.  

**Q: So what will I need to be doing from today until the 30th day?**  

As always you will need to do your Anki and grammar study.  

Your immersion will get more... complicated.  

You will need need to balance reading that manga and your usual immersion.  

Shoving everything into the same day may be too difficult.  

I suggest replacing your reading practice with Yotsubato! instead of Japanese subtitles. It doesn't have to be everyday if you don't want to.  

**Q: How long will it actually take to read 100 pages?**

A: At a pace of 10 minutes per page, it will take 16 hours and 40 minutes.  

If you read it for 1 hour everyday for the rest of the 30 days, you can finish it in time.  

This is assuming your pace stays at 10 minutes per page though!  

Your pace can increase the more you get used to reading Yotsubato.  

### Important! Learning how to read for long hours and making it enjoyable.  
#### Timeboxing

**Pomodoro**  

The Pomodoro timer method is where you focus on a task for a set time (usually 25 minutes) until the timer rings, then you take a break for 5 minutes. When your 5 minutes are up, you go back to focusing.  

Use this Pomodoro timer: [https://pomofocus.io/](https://pomofocus.io/)    

You should reduce the time to 15 minutes if 25 minutes is too long.  

**20 sided dice**

For anyone that isn't feeling like reading for too long on a particular day, you can roll a 20 sided dice to decide how many minutes you're gonna read.  

[Roll a 20 sided dice](https://www.google.com/search?q=roll+a+20+sided+dice)  

Or you could use the 20 sided dice to decide how many minutes reading you're gonna do between anime episodes!  

#### Skimming/Skipping  

Reading isn't about reading all of the text in the book.  

You need to learn how to skip and skim things that don't interest you/annoy you etc.  

If that annoying part of the book was any good then it would make you wanna read it right?  

You can always go back to that one annoying part after you've read the good bits after all.  

If you want to of course.  


#### Take breaks!  

Take breaks if you feel tired/fatigued!  

## Day 15 to Day 30: Daily Japanese Study and Immersion [悪戦苦闘](https://jisho.org/word/%E6%82%AA%E6%88%A6%E8%8B%A6%E9%97%98)!  

Until the 30th day, all I want you to do is:

- Anki
- your grammar study
- "Immersion" = (reading that manga, raw listening anime, subtitle tutor, passive listening, Japanese subtitles)

The method is pretty much that.  

You will be doing the same thing for the next few weeks.  

Keep up with it.  

You're doing great!  

**Q: During this period can I read and watch other things that you haven't talked about?**  

Of course!  

Read what interests you!  

Watch what interests you!  

This study guide (UsagiSpoon) was just making a few of the decisions for you.  


## Day 31 and beyond: After UsagiSpoon?  

At this point, you will have enough of a foundation to proceed with learning on your own.  

There are a few "Japanese learning tasks" I'd like to set you.  

There is no time limit for these tasks.  

Some you might not even be able to do months or years down the line!  

Nevertheless I highly recommend you do them.  

- Finish the entirety of Yotsubato volume 1
- Finish the Core deck   
- Finish the RRTK450 deck  
- Finish Cure Dolly's grammar guide  
- Start studying JLPT N5, N4 and N3 Grammar.  
- Start reading longer texts such as visual novels. Participate in TheMoeWay Discord's VN club to hang out with other people doing the same.  
- When you are comfortable, study JLPT N2 and N1 grammar.  
- Start a "mining" Anki deck some time after you finish the Core deck.  
- Finish a visual novel in under 6 months  
- Try using a monolingual dictionary after you finish a visual novel.  
- Increase your immersion hours.
