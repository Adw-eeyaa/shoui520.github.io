# Japanese Guide

## 1.1 Introduction

Language... is a huge thing. There is so much to it that far exceeds the limitations of a classroom or app-based approach that aims to teach you about the language in a "x means y" or "x does y" format. Learning a  to a high level requires an **enormous** amount of experience hearing and reading the sayings of native speakers. 
It is often difficult to systematically explain why they phrased sentences *that* way instead of *this* way, or why *that* word was used instead of *this* word, which poses a problem for us learners as we can’t express our thoughts in in our target language the same way as native speakers can just by studying the language in a "traditional" manner. 
Attempting to construct sentences in said target language without the required experience often leads to unnatural, or easily misunderstood phrasing. Lack of experience hearing and reading how native speakers use their language often leads to an inability to understand them, due to unfamiliarity with sentences outside of what is taught by a specific learning resource.

This is why in your learning routine, you must prioritize what we call “immersion” – reading and listening to what native speakers write and speak.

## 1.2 Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese

Many people have a simple goal in mind when learning Japanese: to be able to enjoy Japanese content without subtitles/translation and to speak Japanese fluently. However, as it turns out, reaching this goal is not possible with "traditional" methods people usually use to study Japanese. 
"Traditional" methods tend to go like this:
- you learn the alphabet(s)
- you learn basic phrases such as greetings and how to introduce yourself
- you learn basic grammar structure and vocabulary
- you are tasked to create your own sentences either by having conversations with your tutor or study partner, or by writing.
- you are tasked to translate example sentences between your native language to your target language, and vice versa. 
- you may read further explanations of grammar structures and vocabulary with a textbook or it's shown to you in a YouTube video or by a tutor.
- you continue to learn more vocabulary and grammar structures, which becomes your measure of your own ability. 
- the endgame being moving to the country where the language is spoken in hopes of having many opportunities to practice your skills.

While it may seem like a good way to learn a language at first, it does not get us very far when our goal is to reach a high level of Japanese that allows us to enjoy Japanese content in its original form and to speak Japanese fluently. As explained in the previous section, language requires an enourmous amount of experience listening to and reading the language. True language mastery sits far outside the scope of what learning grammar and doing exercises can do.  

## 1.3 The standard of the language

Some of you may be wondering, "But what makes what native speakers say so important?" Simply speaking, how native speakers use their language in different settings sets the standard for the language. They don’t use the same old words, and same old structures in every single setting. How different ideas are expressed can be completely different from the language/s you are familiar with, and the range of ideas that can be formed can completely exceed your expectations – especially given your lack of knowledge. Expressions that are technically grammatically incorrect can even become "correct" when it becomes the norm for native speakers to use the language that way.

As language learners, our standard for "correct Japanese in context" is whatever we are shown in use of the language by natives.

## 1.4 The scale of language

As mentioned in the introduction, language is a huge thing, but you may not realise how big of a thing it actually is. Even you being able to fluently read this guide without trouble is a testament to the scale of language, in particular the scale of language learning.

Language learning is a process of subconsciously memorising patterns through comprehensible input. What this means is, when you understand something (=comprehensible) in your immersion (=input), your brain stores that pattern subconsciously to be accessed later. You see, being able to fluently read this guide is because you have had so much experience reading English in the past that, when you read this, your brain is going, "Oh, there's pattern #234 used with pattern #82 and pattern #10!" 

And because you are a proficient reader in English, you can do this effortlessly. You have seen the same patterns elsewhere. You can detect the tone and level of formality in my writing all thanks to your brain also storing the context, and other information of the patterns you come across.

Notice how I haven't mentioned "knowing the grammar" or "having memorised the vocabulary"? This is because naturally you don't process language in this way. Some of you may not even be native speakers and you may have consciously learned English grammar, but it is unlikely you are actively thinking about it when coming into contact with English every day.

However, sometimes you do have to think extra hard about how to say something complicated, but this is actually the "other side" of learning, known as output.

## 1.5 Input vs output

Input refers to listening to or reading the language.

Output refers to speaking the language, either through speech, through text or by writing.

Your learning routine should be 90% input, especially in the earlier stages of learning. You should also output when you feel like it to ensure you are actually understanding the usages of the things you are seeing in your input. 

## 1.6 Incorporating immersion into study

The methodology covered in this guide consists of an immersion-based approach combined with study.

Your long-term study consists of:

-    learning vocabulary
-    learning grammar structures
-    looking up vocabulary and grammar found in immersion
-    using flashcards to better memorise vocabulary

Immersion usually consists of whatever a native speaker of that language would read or watch. For example a Japanese YouTube video, or an anime, or a book, or a forum post, or even social media, etc.  

As you can see, study pretty much boils down to learning the vocabulary and grammar. This is a crucial step in the learning process. We can't have immersion without study, but we also cannot have study without immersion. 

Immersion must have comprehensible parts to be useful, and likewise, study has to be combined with immersion to be useful.

## 1.7 Stages of learning

Language learning is a long-term endeavour. It should be noted that your experience, as a beginner getting into the language, will differ greatly from an intermediate or advanced learner. The process does not change between intermediate and advanced learners since they have already gotten past the initial hurdle. This guide will steer you through the labyrinthine beginner stage, and then from the intermediate stage and onward.

## 2.1 How to learn Japanese

The learning process for the initial beginner stage consists of:

- learning the hiragana and katakana, which are two of the writing systems of Japanese. These are kind of like alphabets. 
- learning basic vocabulary with their kanji through Anki
- learning grammar
- starting to do mainly listening immersion with easy content and with high repetition

## 2.2 Hiragana and Katakana 

Hiragana and katakana are collectively referred to as the "kana".

Hiragana can be described as the "main alphabet" of Japanese. It's used in grammatical things, parts of words with Japanese origin, for words that aren't usually written in kanji, and sometimes names. It's the curly and cute variant of kana
