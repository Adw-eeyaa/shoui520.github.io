*If you don't need a preface, please skip to [2.1 How to learn Japanese](#21-how-to-learn-japanese)*  

## 1.1 Why many people "fail" to learn Japanese
  
Many people have simple goals in mind when learning Japanese: to enjoy untranslated Japanese content and to speak Japanese fluently. You'll hear everyone say something along those lines when asked about their learning goals. However, many also fail to reach these goals even after years of study. Is the language just too hard? Are they just not studying hard enough?
  
I believe it's actually not their fault, but rather the method's. In language learning, the method behind your learning makes a huge difference in the kind of progress you make.

As it turns out, reaching such goals is not possible with "traditional" methods of Japanese learning. Many students are led to failure for not including a crucial ingredient, **immersion**, into their study routines. **Immersion** refers to listening to or reading native content made for native speakers. For example, anime is originally in Japanese without subtitles, so when consumed in this form, we call it immersion.   

## 1.2 Problems with traditional methods

A Japanese learner following a “traditional” study method would usually go through the following steps:

- Learning the alphabet(s).
- Learning basic sentences such as greetings and self-introductions.
- Learning basic grammar structure and vocabulary.
- Coming up with sentences either by having conversations with a tutor or study partner, or by writing.
- Translating example sentences from their native language to their target language and vice versa.
- Looking up further material about grammar structures and vocabulary in textbooks or YouTube videos recommended by a tutor.
- Practising conversation using knowledge from their study.
- Accumulating more vocabulary and grammar structures, which becomes a measure of one’s own progress

And finally, in the endgame, moving to or visiting Japan in hopes of having opportunities to practise their skills.

None of that is bad in itself, it's actually sufficient study, but it's not enough to get you to a high level of proficiency. The problem is that they aren't actually engaging with the real language—but what do I mean by that?

Let's take swimming as an example. You can't just stay in the baby pool with floaters and take your time to become a pro at the baby pool before attempting to swim in the kids’ pool. This won’t make you a good swimmer. You also can't expect to become a good swimmer by just learning the theory behind the techniques in isolation and practicing them in isolation without actually swimming in a real pool.

How about a more relatable example: competitive video games. You won’t get better at the game just playing against the AI and grinding in training mode all day. You have to play the real game against other people even if you think you’re going to lose by a landslide. This is "playing the real game", with no strings attached.

  It's important to learn how to move on!
</div>

A common trap students fall into in language learning is staying on beginner resources for too long.  

They want to ensure they know every single detail of their basics and refuse to move on to the real language. They refuse to engage in anything they aren't already comfortable with, because they're too afraid of not understanding anything. They feel like they aren't “ready". Yet it’s important to leave your beginner resources as soon as possible because, in reality, you will never be ready until you actually start engaging with the real language and get yourself used to it.  

Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword in language learning. As a perfectionist myself, I've suffered more than I've gained wanting to make sure I've gotten every single detail down of trivial things that didn't really matter in the big picture.  

Learning a language is like climbing a mountain. You can try to climb that mountain without anything assisting your ascent, and though it will take lots of struggle, you will eventually make it if you persist. Traditional study is like building a rope so that it's easier to climb that mountain, but you can't climb the mountain just by making a rope! You eventually have to climb it, because no matter how much rope you decide to make climbing that mountain is still going to be difficult and time-consuming.

## 1.3 The scale of language

Language is… huge. There's so much to it that far exceeds the limitations of a classroom or app-based approach that tries to teach in an "x means y" or "x does y" format. Mastering a language to a higher level requires enormous amounts of experience reading and listening to what native speakers say.

And yet, it's often difficult to grasp why they tend to use *that* phrase in *this* context, or *this* word instead of *that* other one… This creates a barrier for us learners as we can't just study grammar and vocabulary to achieve native-like fluency.

Without the prerequisite experience, attempting to construct sentences in your target langage often leads to unnatural, or difficult to understand phrasing. In turn, lack of experience with how native speakers play with their language makes it difficult to understand them, due to unfamiliarity with phrasing outside of a learning resource's scope.

This is why in your learning routine, **you must “immerse” yourself in the language—read and listen to what natives write and speak.**

Language learning is a process of subconsciously memorizing patterns by the way of comprehensible input. What this means is, when you understand something (comprehensible) in your immersion (input), your brain subconsciously stores that pattern for later information retrieval. You see, being able to comfortably read this guide is only possible because you have had so much experience reading English in the past that, when you read this, your brain thinks something like, "Oh, there's pattern #234 used with pattern #82 and pattern #10!".    

And since you are a proficient English reader, this is done effortlessly. You can understand the words in these sentences. You can understand what links the sentences together. You can even detect the tone and degree of formality in my writing, and it's all thanks to your brain storing the context, and other information of all the language patterns that you've come across.

Notice how I haven't mentioned "knowing the grammar" or "having memorized the vocabulary"? This is because you don't organically process language in this manner. Some readers may not even be native speakers and probably have studied English grammar before, but it is unlikely they're actively thinking about it when coming into contact with English every day.

## 1.4 Coming to terms with sucking 

In language learning, and in anything that requires skill, you are always going to start off struggling for a long time until you get better. As mentioned earlier, many learners (I am guilty of this too) fall into the trap of attempting to master something before ever trying to engage in practise with what they need to work on. For example, a student might fuss over a certain aspect of grammar for way too long and never find the time to move on to something else they are better off spending their time with.

**☝ THIS HERE**, ladies and gentlemen, is what we want to avoid. We have to get into the habit of letting go and start doing what we actually need to do. 

Yes, you won't understand that book or anime perfectly the first time, but that’s not how learning works. It always takes a third, fourth, fifth and even sixth attempt to finally learn something.
<!--
  The phrasing here makes it sound like you're doubling down on the statement just above. instead of just saying that it takes multiple attempts, perhaps mention something along the lines of revisiting in the future with more experience, etc etc). I'm not sure how to fix it so I'm just leaving it be for now
--> 

## 1.5 WHAT EVEN IS "immersion"?  

Immersion is when you interact with natural content in the target language. This means, content that is NOT made for or cherry picked for learners. Content that a native speaker of the language would also consume.  

If you were an English learner, reading this guide right now would be "doing your English immersion, because this guide is not watered down or aimed at English learners, this is written for a native/proficient English speaking audience.  

Thus, when you listen to, or read Japanese content that a Japanese person would also normally consume, you are doing immersion.  

Technically, we would refer to this as *input*, but I like the term *immersion* more. 

## 2.1 How to learn Japanese

### Beginner study process 
The learning process for the beginner consists of:

- Learning the *hiragana* and *katakana*, which are two of the writing systems of Japanese. 
- Learning basic vocabulary and their *kanji* with a program called *Anki*.
- Learning grammar through a *YouTube* playlist.
- Starting immersion with easy content and with high repetition. This is how you will be spending most of your time.

## 2.2 Hiragana and Katakana  

<figure>
  <img src="/img/kana3.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" / alt="HIRAGANA AND KATAKANA IN SCRIPTS>
  <figcaption>"Hiragana" and "Katakana" written in their scripts respectively.</figcaption>
</figure> 

*Hiragana* and *katakana* are two parts of the Japanese writing system with the third part being *kanji*

Japanese's writing system can be described as more of a "syllabary" than an alphabet. It is technically wrong to call these alphabets, as each character represents a syllable rather than a vowel or consonant. Take for example, 「か」, which reads as "ka".  

*Hiragana* and *katakana* are collectively referred to as the "**kana**".  

*Hiragana* and *katakana* represent every sound in the Japanese language. While you can technically write Japanese entirely in *kana*, this isn't how real Japanese is usually written, as it uses a combination of *kana* (*hiragana* and *katakana*), and *kanji*.  

### Hiragana 
<figure>
  <img src="/img/hiragana.png" / alt="HIRAGANA">
  <figcaption>An example of a couple hiragana. This isn't all of them.</figcaption>
</figure> 

*Hiragana* can be described as the "main alphabet" of Japanese. It's the curly and cute variant of *kana*.  
It is usually used in:  

- Grammatical things
- Parts of words with Japanese origin
- Words that aren't usually written in *kanji*

It may also be used in:

- Names

### Katakana
<figure>
  <img src="/img/katakana.png" / alt="KATAKANA">
  <figcaption>An example of a couple katakana. This isn't all of them.</figcaption>
</figure> 
<!--
  Apparently you should define the width and height of images (reduce flickering or something?). I'll leave that to you.
--!>

*Katakana* is the angular and pointy version of kana. It has the exact same sounds as *hiragana*. 
It is usually used in:  

- Foreign, loan words (words borrowed from other languages like English)
- Onomatopoeia words (Japanese is full of these!)
- Slang words

It may also be used in:  

- Names, mainly foreign names

### How you are going to learn the kana

#### Step 1 - the chart

First I want you to take a good look at this *kana* chart.

<figure>
  <img src="img/hiragana_katakana_LARGE.png" / alt="HIRAGANA AND KATAKANA">
  <figcaption>
      Exhaustive list of all hiragana and katakana. Notice that there are some blank spaces. Some of these are kana that have become extinct over time, e.g., the hiragana「ゑ」'we', 「ゐ」'wi'. Sometimes these will be seen in older texts, but they are not picturered here.'
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<a href="/img/hiragana_katakana_LARGE.png" target="_blank">View in browser</a><br>
<a href="/img/hiragana_katakana_LARGE.png" download>Download image</a>

This chart will come in really handy when you are learning to read the *kana*. I recommend you save it.  

Things you can do with the chart:
- Learn to read *kana* by referring to the table. The columns representing vowel sounds, and the rows representing consonant sounds. Since 「か」 is in the A column and the K row, it is pronounced "ka".  
- Learn how they are written by looking at the stroke orders (the little blue arrows and numbers on the characters).  
- Use it as a master reference for all singular *kana*. This will help you a lot when you are learning how to read Japanese.  

#### Step 2 - the YouTube video<br>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/_wZHqOghvSs" target="_blank">Watch this YouTube video</a></h3><br>
It's a 2 hour long video about *hiragana* and *katakana*. It is a great introduction into the *kana*.

#### Step 3 - the grinding
Once you have done that, play this *kana* grinding game.  
<h3><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/kana" target="_blank">The kana grinding game</a></h3><br>

<h4>How to play</h4>

1. Click "show/hide options".
2. Click "check all" for *hiragana*.
3. Start guessing how the *hiragana* are *pronounced*.
4. Repeat until confident (may take a few days or weeks), and then do the same thing but with all "Hiragana combinations" also checked.
5. Repeat until confident, then do it with all "Katakana" also checked, and then with all "Katakana combinations" also checked.

This whole process can take up to 3 weeks to a month depending on the person. Do not feel discouraged if this part of learning Japanese is taking a while, as there are other things to do such as beginner level immersion.

#### Step 4 - reading practice

What also helps immensely in memorising the *kana* is reading sentences in kana.   
Not everything in Japanese is written in kana, and you will have trouble trying to read most things at this point without *kanji* knowledge, but sometimes in Japanese, kana is put over *kanji* to help you read. This is known as *furigana*. An example can be seen here! 
<ruby>
  日本語<rp>(</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>. This just means the Japanese language ("nihongo"). I wrote it in its *kanji* form and put *hiragana* over it.

I recommend practising your *kana* by trying to read some Tadoku graded readers, which you can find [here](https://tadoku.org/japanese/free-books/#l0).

<strong><h3>You do not need to be able to understand anything right now. This is just for getting better at reading kana.</h3></strong><br>

## 2.3 Vocabulary & Kanji

### Kanji, the oddball

<figure>
  <img src="/img/kanji2.jpg" / alt="FIRST 80 KANJI">
  <figcaption>The first 80 kanji taught to Japanese 1st graders.</figcaption>
</figure> 

*Kanji*, meaning "Chinese characters", is another one of the writing systems used in Japanese. They are logographic and are much more complex and wider in variety than *kana*. There are around 2000 to 3000 of them used in Japanese, however, do not let this number demotivate you, because *kanji* are not to be studied and grinded like *kana* are.  

*Kana* are phonetically consistent, simple and few in number so they can be studied in isolation and mastered in a short amount of time, however, *kanji* are not used in the same way as kana and aren't exactly logical. What do I mean by that?

Let's take this as an example. Because *kana* represent sounds in the language, we can write whatever we want according to the sounds as long as a kana exists for it, this includes writing English words. 

Now imagine I wrote the **English** sentence "I am learning Japanese" but using *kana*, it would be:
> "あい　あむ　らあにんぐ　じゃぱにいず"  

Of course, this is ridiculous and there is no reason why you would ever want to do that, but the point being: you aren't exactly able to do this with kanji without it being completely unreadable and incomprehensible.  

Kanji only make sense when they are used in vocabulary.  

I repeat,

<div style="border: 4px solid #333; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 10px; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
  Kanji only make sense when they are used in vocabulary!
</div> 

Every language has A LOT of words, and different words have different meanings, so Chinese, and Japanese for whatever reason decided they are going to use *kanji* to represent these different kind of words and their different meanings. That is why there are so many of them. That is why you shouldn't let them scare you because they are meant to be learned along with the words that use them.
