# Visual novels on iOS

## Non-jailbreak: Using PPSSPP Emulator

Again, there *are* in fact native iOS visual novels, but I feel like emulating PSP visual novels is a better idea, just because the games on a PSP console are just going to be *so* much higher quality than games made for phones.

It is a little more tricky to get PPSSPP working on iOS without a jailbreak, but it is definitely possible.  
You will need:  
[AltStore](https://altstore.io/) - check the [FAQ](https://altstore.io/faq/) on the website for instructions

## Non-jailbreak: Kirikiroid2  

Any games that use the Kirikiri2 engine (e.g. has `.xp3` files) can be loaded and played natively without any virtualization on iOS.

I no longer use an iPhone. The instructions are the same as Android anyway, only difference is you have to use AltStore to install it, and iTunes to transfer files.
