# Visual novels on Android

## The Google Play Store  

There are native Android visual novels but most of these are gacha cash grab trash. There are a few Android ports of Windows visual novels which you can buy at the Japanese Play Store or... *wink* *wink* by "other means". You can switch to the Japanese Play Store by putting on a Japanese VPN and then clearing your Play Store data & cache.  

## Using PPSSSPP Emulator

While they are a couple of native Android visual novels but these are usually spin-offs and gacha trash, and no one wants to play them.

one of the best options is to use [PPSSPP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ppsspp.ppsspp) emulator and download PSP ROMs.

## Vita3k

As technology improves, something that used to be almost completely impossible has now been made normal. That's probably the best way to define the existence of [Vita3k](https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K-Android/releases/) on android phones. With this wonderful software, it's possible to emulate many of the best Japanese games available on the best handheld that a Japanese student could ever ask for. Vita has received official (and unofficial) ports of several different VNs, and all of them are top quality! 

Well, as expected, this emulator is fairly demanding. Most intermediate and high-end smartphones from the last 5~6 years are capable of running most VNs on it, in other words, there are certain minimum requirements that you need to meet before downloading the emulator itself. Here I'll mention all the requirements that are important for running VNs, i.e. commercial games other than VNs are heavier and require more from your smartphone. Therefore, don't expect to run all that much besides VNs with what I'm going to tell you here

#### requirements:

- At least 4GB of ram
- 64-bit processors
- EGL3.2 
- At least something with comparable performance to the snapdragon 732g 

You'll find everything you need to know about setting up Vita 3k on its [oficial_website](https://vita3k.org/quickstart.html), with links to download the necessary files. It's all very simple and takes no more than 10 minutes to get the emulator up and running.

## Kirikiroid2

Any games that use the Kirikiri2 engine (e.g. has `.xp3` files) can be loaded and played natively without any virtualization on Android.  

This is very easy, I got this working in a matter of minutes.  
You will need:  
- Kirikiroid2 APK [[Download]](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813105334763126814/831315953081253938/kirikiri2.apk)  
- Kirikiri2 Engine-compatible visual novel. (Look for `.xp3` files)  
- Kirikiroid2 patch for *YOUR* VN! [[Repository here]](https://zeas2.github.io/Kirikiroid2_patch/patch/)  

Now follow the steps below.  

1. Install the APK of Kirikiroid2. You may need to allow install unknown apps for this source.  
2. On your computer, copy the patch files into the same folder as the game files.
3. Now copy all these files over to your phone.  
4. Launch Kirikiroid2 and navigate to the folder and select the .exe of the VN, just like you'd launch it on your PC.  

## ONScripter

Any games that use the NScripter engine (e.g. has an `nscript.dat` file) can be loaded and played natively without any virtualization on Android.

## QEMU/Limbo/Bochs PC Emulator  

This way is dreadfully slow and I recommend you stay FAR away from this. If you want a portable PC visual novel experience, I recommend you pick up a GPD Win. The first model equipped with an Intel Atom will be fine for VNs, the second model with an Intel Core m3 is more likely to be in stock though.
