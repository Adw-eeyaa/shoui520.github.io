# Reading Strategy and Tips  

Reading is pretty much the most effective way to get better at Japanese. There is no doubt about it.  

"Read more"  is often the first Japanese learning advice that advanced learners of Japanese will give to any beginner.  And for good reason.  

This article aims to give you tips and talk about worries that you may have when reading.  

## Reading Tips  

### I am JUST starting out, what should I do?  

Just starting out = don't know Japanese? See [UsagiSpoon](/routine).  

Noob friendly reading practice = anime with Japanese subtitles, it's described in [UsagiSpoon](/routine)  

Or maybe just starting out = "I have been learning Japanese for a while with [x] way and I want to start reading for real! What should I do?""  

Then read the rest of the article.  

### Visual novels = better for beginners?  

Visual novels are better for beginners because they don't have to rely on a lot more descriptive text in order to create a story because visual novels have pictures on the screen etc.  

They are more approachable than novels difficulty-wise and therefore they are perfect for easing yourself into reading.  

See [my visual novel guide](/vn) to learn how to learn Japanese with visual novels.  

### Yomichan + Textractor + Texthooker page  

The holy trinity of Japanese learning (for visual novel enjoyers).  

Everything you need to know is in [VN guide](https://nyaa.si/view/1350523)  

### Read the book of something you've seen  

Did you know many people become readers (in their native language) because they read the book of a movie they liked or something? 

Learning how to visual scenes in your head is a different skill than just "Be native".  

You can apply the same exact strategy to Japanese. 

And it's the strategy that I recommend everyone takes when they get into reading.  

**Read the light novel series of an anime you liked.**  

Read the novel after you watch the anime, or even while watching the anime. And after you've seen the anime still refer to the anime to help you read. 

Anyway this is obviously a God tier reading strategy because by watching the anime you have given context to the text on the page which translates into i+1 Krashen approved effective language learning gains and also the light novel will have multiple volumes which is great for learners because getting used to 1 author's writing style is easier than reading a different author every time.

### Pomodoro / Timeboxing  

This is another God tier strategy that I'd like to introduce to you. 

The Pomodoro method is when you focus on a task (usually 25 minutes) and after your focus minutes are up, the timer rings and you have a short break (usually 5 minutes.)  

So you will be reading in 20 minute sessions.  

It doesn't really sound like much, but it is actually a very useful method.  

I usually drink water or get up / walk around during break times, it helps to get refreshed before reading again.  

Here's the Pomodoro timer that I use.  **[Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/)**  

The default settings are 25 minutes focus, 5 minute short break and 15 minute long break.  

However I feel like the 25 minutes are too much, so I recommend **20 minutes** instead.  

You can click *Setting* at the top to change this. Also I recommend you turn on Auto Start breaks and pomodoros.  

### The act of making reading a habit - baby steps!  

You aren't going to become a crazy reader seen at the top of TheMoeWay's Discord reading leaderboard overnight. 

You need to make reading into a habit; do reading in amounts that are manageable to you every day.  

And overtime, when you do this every day, it will become a habit, and you may feel like reading without thinking about "time to improve my Japanese", because reading every single day will become a normal thing for you.  

### My Comprehension Tip  

*This is a tip for more experienced learners*  

This is the only comprehension tip that actually works for me.  

The trick is to focus on nouns (and numbers).  

I came up with the idea when I noticed when I read in English, the nouns stand out.  

Nouns are names, people, objects, places, etc.  

I felt like there is some type of word hierarchy.  

Any nouns/numbers → "action" verbs → adjectives → "abstract" verbs.  

And of course, within nouns there is also a noun hierachy, with names, pronouns and physical objects being at the top.  

I noticed when I read Japanese, it feels a lot more hazy because my brain just doesn't make the nouns stand out more than adjectives or verbs.  

I started to "focus"(I hate to use this term because that's not what I am actually doing, it's more like noticing) on the nouns in sentences and noticed how my comprehension skyrocketed without losing speed.  

It can be a little tricky to notice nouns every time they come up but trust me this is an S tier strategy and all you need is practice.    

### The usefulness of grammar study and some specific Yomichan dictionaries.  

Honestly grammar study is very useful for reading.  

If you haven't studied a lot of grammar and don't know all JLPT N5, N4, N3, N2 and N1 grammar points, then I highly recommend you study them. But I don't mean this to say "study jlpt grammar before reading", "I mean, study jlpt grammar to improve your reading experience, which you should be doing, probably right about now"  

I want you to watch [Cure Dolly's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj) (your basic fundamentals) then study JLPT grammar with [medamayaki's JLPT grammar deck](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778430038159655012/972368473751703572/Nihongo-Kyoshi-complete.apkg).  

Listen, I don't care if JLPT grammar is not "actually grammar".  

They are useful to study because they are phrases and structures in Japanese that have a rather ambiguous meaning just from the words alone, so you are likely to miss them in immersion.  

You really can't go wrong studying JLPT grammar.  

Now, the Yomichan dictionaries I really want you to use are: 

- ALL the grammar ones.  
- 実用日本語表現辞典
- Your favourite monolingual dictionary. (if you dont have a favourite then use either one of my favourites: 新明解国語辞典 第七版、明鏡国語辞典 第二版(doesnt work with anki btw) or 旺文社国語辞典 第十一版)  

If you can't understand monolingual dictionaries yet, still keep them because if you ever get stuck on what a word actually means, the monolingual dictionary will come through.  

### Comprehension tip: Bilingual vs Monolingual = The difference between not knowing what's going vs actually understanding?

In many cases, yes.  

Bilingual definitions can be too ambiguous sometimes, so it is always best to check the monolingual dictionary.    

## Reading nayamigoto (aka stuff you worry too much about) 

### Reading Speed  

I'm just gonna go out and say this right now.  

You will only get faster at reading by reading more.  

You are only able to read at that speed you are at right now because that is the speed someone, who has read the amount you have and the material you have, would be reading at in a perfectly normal situation.  


### READING SPEED TIPS AND TRICKS    

I have some breaking news for you... the best reading speed technique is to read more.  

But let me explain the magic behind it and the magic behind reading speed.  

Reading speed is comprehension.  

When you read more, you will comprehend more.  

Do not be worrying about reading speed if you don't already understand a lot/know all of the words in most books!  

**Q:** Should i read a ton of manga if i want to get fast at reading wikipedia articles?  

A: No. Specialization is required to get faster at reading at what you want.  



### Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1   

Type 1: "I have been staring at this sentence/paragraph/word/thing for ages and I have no idea what it is saying"  

Solution?  

The obvious thing to do is to look up the words and grammar used in the sentence, and also refer to the context (read previous lines).   

But what if you've already done that but you still didn't understand?    

The simple answer is to read more.  

Because comprehension is a gradual process.  

The factors that go into "comprehending/understanding" are much more broad than "knowing the word" and "have studied the grammar".  

When you read more you will see words used in many, many different contexts. 

And it is through your experience seeing these words in different contexts, you learn to comprehend more sentences.  

As much as I don't like to admit it, there is another way of training comprehension too. And that is by analyzing the sentence by referring to grammar points, dictionary definitions, example sentences, HiNative and Yahoo!知恵袋 answers etc. If you have the drive to do all of that then I'd say you can't go wrong with that but at the same time there is no way you can't be not improving by just reading more so I would say this decision is all on you. Perhaps learning to balance analyzing and just reading more is a useful skill to have.  

Anyway the ultimate solution is to try your best and read more.  

### Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 1.5  

Type 1.5: "I have type 1 comprehension anxiety. I absolutely despise not understanding, I want to understand everything. I am a high believer in analyzing sentences. But how much should I actually do it?"   

And as a high believer in reading more and ex-high believer in analyzing sentences I'd say there is only so much comprehension you can get out of analyzing unfamiliar sentences; the learner that has read a ton will understand a lot more than the learner that just analyzes everything.  

Analyzing is by no means bad I just think you should do it in moderation because reading more sentences will benefit you more than hyperfocusing on the same one.  

### Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 2   

Type 2: "When I am reading for a while my brain turns to mush and I read too fast and things slip through my comprehension"  

Honest advice:  I think you should just suck it up and read slower. Also take breaks. I often have times where after a break I comprehend the same sentences more.  

### Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 2.5

Type 2.5: "I can read all the words, I know all their meanings, but I can't visualize the scene! I don't understand what is actually going on! I have to analyze and even then I have no clue what is happening, what should I do?"  

I know this is very hard for you but here's what you need to do:

- read more 

**Q:** Is that it? Come on! I'm sure there is something else I could do that would really improve my situation right now.  

A: Well everything boils down to "read more". The theory behind why I answered with "read more" is because: Your comprehension lacks because the kinds of sentences you struggle with are sentences you are unfamiliar with. In language acquisition, force feeding yourself too-unfamiliar sentences is not as effective as understanding i+1 sentences. (only 1 thing in the sentence you aren't so comfortable with, these "things" may not even be identifiable). When you read more **you will come across a crap ton of sentences**, and within these sentences, there will be plenty of i+1 sentences, and this is the peak of your language acquistion gains. Therefore, after reading a lot you will become better at Japanese, and you'll struggle less with those hard to visualize, hard sentences.  

### Comprehension Nayamigoto Type 3

Type 3: "I feel like I'm only half-understanding"  

Just read more, read more sentences and you'll start understanding other sentences!!  



### The case for reading faster  

OK, in my experience, trying to make yourself read faster just makes you understand less. But we all want to be able to keep our comprehension whilst also reading faster right? Yes, but you can only get to that level if you read a lot.  

If you a read a lot, you will end up reading sentences/words in clumps right?  

I consciously made mental conceptualizations of parts of sentences in order to read them in clumps.  

This is just a fancy way of saying "this means this, there is no need to read word for word, and i will keep a note of it".  

**Q:** No subvocalization = no comprehension?  

In my experience, when the words/sentences you are choosing to not subvocalize are not that familiar to you (i.e. you cannot understand it just by glancing at it. An example that experienced readers should understand without reading word for word is なければならない) then you will end up not understanding what it is actually saying.  

Subvocalizing is a useful reading technique and most people do it and if you read a lot your subvocalization will just get faster.  

So don't stop subvocalizing because you think it's slowing you down. It is not. The only things slowing you down is: You worrying too much about speed and character count, the fact that you haven't read enough and it is pretty much common sense that you wouldn't be lightning fast at reading a text in a language you basically don't have much experience with when compared to a native.  

Reading more is the crux of increasing reading speed, so don't forget!    


### I can't read! I am not a reader! I am too dumb/adhd/young/bad memory to read!
C O P E.  

And a cope I lived with until I realized all you need is a good book.  

And timeboxing.  



### OK BUT how MUCH do I have to read???

Kinda a dumb question because you never stop reading because you can always get better.   

But how much do you need to read in order to get really proficient, you may ask?  

I don't know the exact number but after 300 novels you would be pretty good.  

If you mine the entirety of around 30-40 novels and use monolingual dictionaries you will have a very decent vocabulary size and you will understand a lot more from listening and whatever.  

But knowing the words is only the beginning of being a proficient reader imo.  

Anyway stop thinking how much you will be reading because it is not a productive use of your time calculating the amount of books you need to read until you never look at text again, lol.
